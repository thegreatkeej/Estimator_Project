#### Make It Honest

* Using **slide 11**, point out that the most important aspect of a data visualization is that it accurately represents the data. It doesn't matter how flashy and dazzling it is if it doesn't represent the data correctly. First and foremost, it must maintain visual integrity.

#### Make It Effective

* Using **slide 13**, point out that we can make the visualization effective by emphasizing the parts of our data story that are the most important. 

#### Make It Pretty

* Using **slide 14**, point out that after we've made sure we're telling an honest data story to as wide an audience as possible, emphasizing the most important parts of our data story, we make our visualizations stand out.
