### 2. Presentation Tips and Tricks

| Activity Time: 0:20 |  Elapsed Time: 0:30  |
|---------------------------|---------------------------|

<details>
  <summary><strong> üì£ 2.1 Instructor Do: Presentation Tips and Tricks (0:20)</strong></summary>

* You can use slides 10 - 22 to assist you with this activity. Let the students know to keep these concepts in mind as they continue to work on their visualizations.

#### Know Your Audience

* Use **slides 11 and 12** to point out to students that even though they are presenting one project, there are multiple ways to deliver their presentation. For instance, if presenting their results to executives, they may focus on high-level summaries that demonstrate a business value; however, if they were to present at a tech conference, their focus would be on the problem-solving hurdles they overcame. Knowing their audience means creating a better-defined takeaway and structuring the presentation in a way that engages the audience.

#### Define Your Takeaway

* Use **slides 13 and 14** to point out that once we know our audience, we can tailor what we want them to take away from the presentation. Ideally, this is one sentence that captures the most salient parts of the project. 

* To help students decide what important parts of the project to include in the presentation, have them ask themselves, ‚Äúwhat do you want your audience to walk away with from this presentation? 

* Being honest and knowing the audience will help determine what is important for the presentation and what is superfluous. As students structure their presentation, they should keep coming back to the takeaway, asking themselves, "does this help the audience take the right message from this?" 

#### Structure Your Presentation

* Use **slides 15 - 17** to point out that once they know their audience and what to present, students should start focusing on the structure of their presentation.

* As they build the presentation, keep the amount of information to a minimum on each slide. Too much text and images can be distracting to the audience. Having two or three bullet points and an image is sufficient. 

* Use **slide 17** to show the basic structure of a presentation, and go over the following:

* **Greeting**
  * The greeting is a short introduction of the speaker(s), not the introduction of the topic. It serves as a gentle transition to start the talk and can also help build rapport with the audience. 

* **Introduction**
  * This is where they introduce the general topic and background information necessary to understand the specifics of the topic. With the introduction, they are preparing the audience for the rest of the talk. They will inform the audience what will be covered, how long the talk is, and what level of audience interaction is expected. 

* **Main Body**
  * This is the bulk of the talk. Here, they will be delivering on what they promised in the introduction. If there are multiple points to the main body, they should be summarized before moving on.
  * The main body of the talk is their chance to make sure the audience leaves with the takeaway defined earlier. The conclusion is only for reinforcement! 

* **Conclusion**
  * In the conclusion, they should summarize and reinforce what was stated in the **Main Body**. No new information should be added here; they are only distilling the information stated earlier. There may be a few takeaways from the main body, but the conclusion is their chance to hit them with those one or two takeaways.

* **Invite Questions**
  * Finally, they should thank the audience and invite questions. Q&A sessions are great ways to get their audience to have a deeper understanding, but they need a solid foundation in the previous parts of the presentation. Again, the Q&A session should not be used to patch weak portions of the presentation; it should serve to clarify the audience's understanding.

* Once the structure is defined, students should add transitions between each point. This includes transitioning from the basic structure points but also transitioning between points in the main body. 

#### Practice!

* Use **slides 18 and 19**, to point out that once they have structured their presentation, they should practice the delivery! The smoother a presentation goes, the more confident the speaker appears‚Äîand the more confident the audience will be in the speaker and their assertions. Here are some points to consider:

  * Rehearsing the presentation will help find any rough patches, language that is tricky to pronounce, or sections that go too quickly or slowly. 
  * Tell students to present in a mirror or record themselves to see how their presentation will come across to the audience. 
  * Tell them to record themselves to see if they are within the time limits. This will help determine if they need to speak less on some slides.   
  * Tell them to practice for difficult questions that audience members might ask and have a slide or two to answer those questions if time permits.

#### Engage Your Audience

* Use **slides 20 - 22**, to point out to students that when they are presenting, they need to make sure to capture the audience's attention and hold it throughout the presentation. Students can tell stories and use humor to create a rapport with the audience. A speaker sharing their interest and enthusiasm in a topic can be infectious, causing the audience to become interested and enthusiastic as well. Asking questions to the audience involves them in the presentation and is another tool to capture their attention. 

* Students need to make sure that their presentation is clear. If the audience feels that the presentation is off topic and introduces an unfamiliar term, they are likely to lose enthusiasm as they struggle to figure out what it means through context clues. Defining terms frees the audience to stay engaged with the topic. Similarly, using concrete examples and analogies can make lofty, esoteric subjects easier to grasp.

* Finally, using previews and summaries can help guide the audience through trickier parts by preparing them for what's coming and giving them another chance to understand if they lost some of the finer details along the way. 

* Answer any questions before moving on to the next activity.

### 3. Preparing for Technical Issues

<details>
  <summary><strong> üì£ 3.1 Instructor Do: Preparing for Technical Issues (0:25)</strong></summary>

* Open a discussion with students about preparing for technical difficulties that may arise on the day of presentations. 

* Consider creating and sharing a collaborative document on Google Drive that students can edit or amend. Let students know that it is impossible to prepare for every possible thing that could go wrong, but it's still worth thinking through possible points of failure and creating contingency plans. As students bring up possible points of failure, ask the rest of the class for reasonable efforts that could be made in response. 

* Use **slide 24** to go over the following examples:

| Problem                                                  | Potential Solutions                                                    |
|----------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Hardware Failure                                         | Save copies of presentation to another computer or cloud-based storage |
| Notes saved in slides, but only able to share on slide | Print out hard copies of slides                                        |
| Relying on Live Demo, but underlying data changes        | Create a "dummy" version relying on static data                        |
| Relying on Live Demo, but demo fails/gets corrupted      | Pre-record video demoing functionality                                 |

* Answer any questions before moving on to the next activity.

* Have the students work on their final project, and let them know that you'll be checking in on the progress each team has made on their project. 

* Create breakout rooms for each team, and have them begin working on their project. If a team is not currently checking in with you, they should be focusing on their project goals for this segment.

* Encourage participation by reminding them that this is their time to ask questions and get assistance from their instructional staff as they‚Äôre working on their projects over Zoom with their team members, so they should take full advantage of the time.

* Expect that students may ask for assistance with the following:

  * Deploying their app on Heroku 
  * Finalizing their presentations
  * Finalizing their dashboard
  * Debugging
  * Computer issues 

* **Note:** Depending on the number of teams in your cohort, break up the time allotment to spend an equal amount of time with each team.

* Answer any questions before ending class.
