# Module 20-2 Class 1: Dashboard Best Practices and Project Work

## Overview

This week‚Äôs session, **Project Week ‚Äì Build the Pieces**, will be spent covering dashboarding best practices as well as the pros and cons of three different machine learning models. This is to help learners determine which model will fit best with their projects. Teams should already have a good idea about the type of model they'll be using, and the extra time this week should solidify which model they‚Äôll use. 

Today, students will discuss how to build a Stellar dashboard during the first half of the class, then they‚Äôll spend time working on their group project during the second half of the class. 

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:

* Understand the best practices to follow when creating a dashboard

## Instructor Notes

* **Set expectations for the session** by telling students that today will be used to provide best practices for building dashboards.

* **Share the links to dashboarding best practices.** Let students know that they can apply the logic from articles about building dashboards with Tableau to any dashboard they create. 

* **Open the floor for questions.** Encourage students to discuss dashboards and why the current best practices are in place. When students share their screen, encourage them to mute their notifications and use an incognito window to avoid sharing any personal information.

* If you have issues with any of today's activities, you may report it [here](http://tiny.cc/BootCampFeedback).

* **This Week - Final Project:** Talk through the key skills students will be learning this week. Day 1 activities are designed to cover dashboard best practices and provide students with time to work on their final project. Day 2 activities will be used to discuss the pros and cons of three different machine learning models and to determine which model will fit best with each team‚Äôs project. Teams will also be checking with the instructor to make sure they are on track according to the rubric. 

* **How to Succeed This Week:** Remind your students that they may encounter roadblocks or moments of frustration when learning the following skills: refining and training their machine learning model, cleaning the data and creating visualizations, transforming and loading data in the database, and integrating the database with the project. Consider sharing something about your personal learning journey. It helps students to recognize that everyone starts somewhere and that they are not alone.

* **Today's Objectives:** Now, outline the concepts that will be covered in today's lesson. Remind students that they can find the relevant activity files in the ‚ÄúGetting Ready for Class‚Äù page in their course content.

### 2. Dashboarding Best Practices

<details>
  <summary><strong> üì£ 2.1 Instructor Do: Dashboard Best Practices (0:10)</strong></summary>

* You can use slides 9 - 18 to assist you for this activity.

* Depending on the number of students present, either create separate groups or work together as a single group. 

* Ask the students what story they want their data to tell. Do they have a goal? What kind of message will their dashboard display? This information should be on hand before a dashboard is planned out and built.

* The goal of a dashboard is to convey data in a clear, concise manner. A good rule of thumb is for the dashboard to be understood by a neutral party within five minutes; that is, they are able to view it, interact with it, and understand the data in that amount of time. There are several different techniques that align with best practices. Here are a few examples:

* **Reduce the Clutter and Optimize**

  * Although spreadsheets are awesome and can contain tons of helpful information, it's often too much to take in quickly. Narrow it down to the pertinent information, such as a trend.

  * Graphs and charts can also be visually overstimulating. Simple is often best in these cases; if a user wants to gain more information about the topic, then they can drill down into the data for more detail.

  * Think of the top-five things you want users to take away from your dashboard, and focus on them. This streamlines the data being displayed and makes it easier and quicker to process. 

* **Streamline the Layout**

  * Don't toss all of the visualizations together just because you have them. Arrange them so that the flow of data being displayed makes sense. 

  * Start with the key data&mdash;the data that presents users with the biggest takeaway. 

* **Make Use of Color**

  * Adding color and/or gradients to visualizations and your dashboard helps make the data stand out. It's visually appealing and helps users take the information in more easily. 

  * Use color correctly. For example, a heatmap typically uses warmer colors to represent higher concentrations of data. If the color scheme was flipped, it may be confusing. 

* **Integrate Interactivity**

  * Letting users interact with the dashboard helps engage their interest. 

  * Interactivity includes tooltips, drilling down further into data, filters, and navigation. 

* Here are a few helpful articles written about dashboards that will help guide a team's decision.

|---------------------------|---------------------------|

<details>
  <summary><strong>üì£  3.1 Instructor Do: Project Development Consultation (1:35) </strong></summary>

* Have the students work on their final project; let them know that you'll be checking in on each team‚Äôs progress. 

* Create breakout rooms for each team, and have them begin working on their project. If a team is not currently checking in with you, they should be focusing on their project goals for this segment.

* Encourage participation by reminding them that this is their time to ask questions and get assistance from their instructional staff as they‚Äôre working on their projects over zoom with their team members, so they should take full advantage of the time.

* Expect that students may ask for assistance with the following:

  * Which tool to use to create a dashboard
  * Increasing the responsiveness of dashboards
  * How exactly to decide which machine learning model to use
  * Other project-related questions relating to databases, GitHub, or their topic 

**Note:** Depending on the number of teams in your cohort, break up the time allotment to spend an equal amount of time with each team.

* Answer any questions before ending class.
