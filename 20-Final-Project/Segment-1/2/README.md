# Module 20-1 Class 2: Project Work 

## Overview

In todayâ€™s class, teams will be checking in with you to present the progress they've made on their project. During this segment, all teams should have settled on a topic for their analysis. If they havenâ€™t found a dataset, they should continue trying to find a dataset. If they have the data they need, then they should be performing rudimentary EDA on the dataset. All teams should be making significant progress on their database and machine learning model mockups. 

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students should be able to:

* Present a project to stakeholders
* Design a database using ERD
* Design a machine learning model

  <summary><strong>ðŸ“£  Instructor Do: Office Hours</strong></summary>

Encourage students to take full advantage of office hours by reminding them that this is their time to ask questions and get assistance from instructional staff on their final project.

* Expect that students may ask for assistance with the following: 

  * Deciding on a topic for their project
    * This should be solidified by the end of this week!  
  * Searching for a dataset or complementary datasets
  * Getting started with exploratory data analysis
  * Deciding on a machine learning model
  * Creating a mockup or fabricated database using an ERD.
  * Debugging
  * Help with computer issues
  * Guidance with a particular tool
  * Creating pull requests / branches on GitHub

## During Class 

### 1. Getting Started

| Activity Time:       0:05 |  Elapsed Time:      0:05  |
|---------------------------|---------------------------|

<details>
  <summary><strong>ðŸ“£ 1.1 Instructor Do: Foundation Setting (0:05)</strong></summary>

* Welcome students to class.

* Direct students to post individual questions in the Zoom chat to be addressed by you and your TAs at the end of class.

* Open the slideshow and use slides 1 - 4 to walk through the foundation setting with your class.

* **This Week - Final Project:** The teams should have decided on a project topic. They should now be searching for a dataset or complimentary dataset(s), performing EDA on the datasets that they have found, outlining a database ERD, and selecting a machine learning model.

* **Today's Objectives:** Now, outline the concepts covered in today's lesson.

### 2. Group Project Check-In and Comparison with Rubric

| Activity Time:       0:15 |  Elapsed Time:      0:20  |
|---------------------------|---------------------------|

<details>
  <summary><strong>ðŸŽ‰  2.1 Everyone Do: Group Project Check-In (0:05)</strong></summary>

* Open the [Zoom Polling](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/213756303-Polling-for-Meetings) feature or a [Poll Everywhere](http://www.polleverywhere.com), then launch a poll of the class to identify areas that they would like to review regarding this week's project week.

* **Poll Text:**
How are you feeling about the current state of your project?

  * It's ready for the next stage!
  * I'm a little stressed, but it'll be ready for the next stage in time.
  * I'm really worried. Help!
  * I haven't started yet. Help!

* Use the results to gauge how the groups are feeling, and keep the results in mind during check-ins.

* **Note** If there is a group that wants to do a custom project, or if a student wants to do a solo project meet, with them during the check-ins and use the [Final Project Decision Tool](https://github.com/coding-boot-camp/DataViz-Online/blob/master/04-Instructor-Resources/resources/final_project_decision_tool.md) to guide them.

<details>
    <summary><strong> ðŸ“£2.2 Instructor Do: Slide Show (0:05)</strong></summary>

* You can use slides 5 - 9 to assist you with this activity.  

* Using **slide 6**, explain that by this point, students should have the following points completed; if they do not make sure to get to this point as soon as possible, they risk falling too far behind schedule.

* Using **slide 7**, explain the importance of dealing with group work. When students move on to the real world, they will almost always be working with a team where collaboration is important.

* Using **slide 8**, explain that today is a good chance to focus solely on group projects and working together. You and the TAs are available to help for the whole class. The instructional team will also go around to have the groups pitch their idea to them.

* Using **slide 9**, explain that when a member of the instructional staff first approaches the group, they should be pitching their idea like they would to a shareholder. The groups should be prepared to talk about what they hope to achieve, what steps are being taken, their current progress, and what they plan on getting done by next week.

<details>
    <summary><strong> ðŸ“£ 2.3 Instructor Do: Compare to Rubric (0:05)</strong></summary>

* One way to help teams stay on track is by comparing the team's work progress to the first segment's rubric. Understanding how close they are to each deliverable will tell you a few things.

* First, if they aren't meeting any milestones, it could be an indicator that they're lost or stuck. Alternatively, it could also mean that they aren't very efficient with their time. This is a great opportunity to help realign strategies and goals as needed.

* Click [here](Resources/Segment_1_rubric.pdf) to view the rubric for the first segment.

### 3. Group Project Check-ins

| Activity Time:       1:35 |  Elapsed Time:      1:55  |
|---------------------------|---------------------------|

<details>
    <summary><strong> ðŸ“£ 3.1 Instructor Do: Conduct Check-ins (1:35)</strong></summary>

* You can use slide 10 to let the students know that the check-ins are starting.

* Next, begin the check-in with each team to assess how much progress each team has made on their project. This is the first time during this cohort that students will be working in groups, so be prepared for various challenges, such as staying on task, searching for and finding a dataset or complimentary dataset(s), performing EDA, setting up and accessing the database, selecting the right machine learning model, and dealing with team conflicts.

* Create breakout rooms for each team and have them begin working on their project. When a team is not checking in with you during this time, they should be focusing on their project goals for this segment.

* **Note:** Depending on the number of teams in your cohort, break up the time allotment to spend an equal amount of time with each team.

* Begin the check-in by encouraging the team to talk you through their project. They should have a topic or question to present along with the data they've chosen. Consider the following questions:

  * Are the topic and data the team sustainable for the duration of the project?
  * Does the team already have a plan to fully implement the database?
  * Does the team have a machine learning module in mind? And how will it add value to their analysis?

<details>
  <summary><strong>ðŸ“£  4.1 Instructor Do: Project Progression&mdash;Next Steps (0:05) </strong></summary>

* You can use slides 11 and 12 to assist you with this activity. 

* Before ending class, let the teams know where they should be in their project timeline. 

* For the next class, the students should have completed the following:
  * The machine learning model should move from the mockup phase to the functioning phase where it can make a prediction or classification, but it needs some optimization. 
  * The database needs to move from the fabricated or mockup phase to the integrated phase where you can retrieve the data in the database.
  * Create an outline for the final dashboard with a storyboard of visualizations. 
  * Continue using GitHub to create and merge code on branches.
