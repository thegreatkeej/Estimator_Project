# Estimator_Project
(THIS PROJECT IS CURRENTLY IN PROGRESS)

## Motivation
The supply chain industry utilizes a "hot sheet" (a list of materials and their prices generated once a quarter) to price their materials. With the rise of inflation, material prices must be generated the day the estimate is created. This increase in pricing frequency leads to excessive hours spent scouring the net searching for current material prices.

## Supplemental Information
Small items, typically purchased with large material, are not directly priced. Rather, a percentage is tagged to the cost of your main material to account the cost of the small items.

*For example*
> When an electrician installs 10 feet of pipe, in addition to the pipe, they will need two connectors, two straps and possibly one coupling. To Account for the costs, estimators will add on a percentage of the bid to cover the small items.
