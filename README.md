# Estimator_Project

## Purpose
To save estimators time, We are creating a live HTML/website that uses APIs to search material prices of three electrical materials suppliers. With the data collected, we will produce a table that can be updated daily. This table will list material prices and our algorithm will choose the cheapest priced items of the day to populate our table.
